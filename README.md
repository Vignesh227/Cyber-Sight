A simple network analytics dashboard that does IP Profiling and DDoS Attack Detection, for designated network logs

## IP Profiling 🙎🏻‍♂️
- IP Profiling involves the subtle understanding of network traffic, where every device and user is meticulously scrutinized, profiling their behavior to identify anomalous patterns.

## DDoS Attack ⚠️
- A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
